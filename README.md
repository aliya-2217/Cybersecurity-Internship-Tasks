## Task 01 — Networking Fundamentals, Nmap Scanning, and Automation Scripting

### 🔍 Overview
This task focused on mastering the fundamentals of network scanning and automation using **Nmap** and **Python**.  
The goal was to identify open ports, analyze potential security risks, and automate the scanning process.

### 📂 Files Included
- `task01_report.pdf` — Complete documentation and scan analysis.
- `nmap_automation.py` — Python script automating Nmap scans.
- `scan_report.txt` — Consolidated results from SYN, TCP, and UDP scans.
- `open_ports.csv` — Extracted list of open ports and detected services.

### 🧠 Key Learnings
- Performed and analyzed **Nmap** scans (`-sS`, `-sT`, `-sU`) effectively.
- Identified and understood open ports, running services, and associated risks.
- Automated scanning with **Python (python-nmap)** and generated structured reports.
- Strengthened understanding of **network protocols** and **vulnerability enumeration**.

## Task 02 — Packet Sniffing, Firewall Configuration, and Vulnerability Scanning

### 🔍 Overview
This task involved three major parts:
1. **Packet Sniffing** using Python (Scapy)
2. **Firewall Configuration** using iptables
3. **Vulnerability Scanning** using OpenVAS

### 📂 Files Included
- `task02_report.pdf` — Complete documentation and screenshots.
- `packet_sniffer.py` — Python script for packet capture.
- `capture.pcap` — Raw packet capture output.

### 🧠 Key Learnings
- Captured and analyzed network packets using Scapy.
- Configured iptables to manage incoming/outgoing traffic.
- Performed vulnerability scans using OpenVAS and interpreted results.
