## 📌 Task 01: Networking Fundamentals, Nmap Scanning, and Automation Scripting
- **Report**: [task01_report.pdf](./Task01/Report/task01_report.pdf)
- **Automation Script**: [nmap_automation.py](./Task01/Automation/nmap_automation.py)
- **Outputs**: `scan_report.txt`, `open_ports.csv`

### Key Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience with Nmap (`-sS`, `-sT`, `-sU` scans).
- Identified open ports and analyzed security risks.
- Automated scans using Python (`python-nmap`) and generated structured reports.
